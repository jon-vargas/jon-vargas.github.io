If  you're reading this, thanks! There isn't much here for now, but I have plans to add more in the future. This site I'm going to use to post, honestly whatever, however my main objective is to use it for personal growth and devlopment in  my career. Along the way I'm going to tailor the site to my liking, so expect some changes here and there. I'm excited to learn and upload personal projects, stay tuned!
