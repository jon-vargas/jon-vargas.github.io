<p> So I'll try to keep this short. After graduating from UC Irvine with a Bachelor's degree in Economics and a Minor in Management, I landed this job Where I'm at currently as a Junior Data Analyst at Zillow. Peculiar job for a Econonmics undegrad, I know. I grew up with an interest in computers, video games, and overall technology. I followed this interest by receiving an Associate's of Computer Science... not really much. But after seeing the classes laid out that I ndded to take, I figured I could self-teach this stuff and went the finance route.</p>
