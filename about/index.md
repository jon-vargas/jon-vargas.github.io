So who am I? I'm just someone who has a variety of interests I'd like to learn more about.

I plan to use this website as a personal portfolio and a creative outlet. My goals are to display a certain level of technical aptitude, become more adept in learning new topics/languages, share knowledge, and to serve as some self-accountability to progress on other stuff. If you'd like to see a bit more my other projects or ambitions of mine, please check out my posts. As I spend more time on this website, it will receive many changes so expect some updates. I plan to track any changes I make within a changelog I will add later. I enjoy hearing from others, whether it's professional or a friendly conversation, so please don't hesitate to contact me! Cheers.
