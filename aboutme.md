<p>I'm just someone who has a variety of interests I'd like to learn more about, including starting a wesite. If I were to try to categorize them, I'd list them as: programming, health science, and the environment - you'll see this trend emerge across the topics I discuss. I like to have projects and goals to work on, I feel it gives life more substanance aside from work. </p>
<p>I plan to use this website as a personal portfolio and  creative outlet. My goals are to display a certain level of technical aptitude, become more adept in learning, share knowledge, and to serve as some self-accountability to progress on other stuff. If you'd like to see a bit more of other projects, goals, ambitions of mine, click here or navigate to the "Now" link in the sidebar. I enjoy hearing from others, whether it's professional or a friendly conversation, so please don't hesitate to contact me! Cheers. </p>
